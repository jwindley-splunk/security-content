eli5: Attackers will often attempt to disable security tools in order to evade detection.
  It is also possible for end users to attempt to disable anti-virus or other security
  tools to circumvent restrictions they encounter while trying to execute other programs.
  One way malware may accomplish this is by adding the legitimate certificate used
  to sign the security software to the untrusted certificate store. This will cause
  the system to no longer trust the software signed with this certificate and disallow
  it from executing. This search simply looks for the execution of **certutil.exe**
  with the parameters `-addcert` and `disallowed`, which add a certification to the
  "untrusted" certificate store.

how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your
  hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You must also be
  ingesting logs with both the process name and command line from your endpoints.
  The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process" field in the Endpoint data
  model.

known_false_positives: There may be legitimate reasons for administrators to add a
  certificate to the untrusted certificate store. In such cases, this will typically
  be done on a large number of systems.
