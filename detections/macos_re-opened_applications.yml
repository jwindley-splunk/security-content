eli5: The search looks at the Endpoint data model to identify any MacOS process events referencing a property list file which determines which applications are "re-opened" during startup. This could indicate a malicious attempt to establish persistence on the system.

how_to_implement: In order to properly run this search, Splunk needs to ingest process data
  from your osquery deployed agents with the [splunk.conf](https://github.com/splunk/TA-osquery/blob/master/config/splunk.conf)
  pack enabled. Also the [TA-OSquery](https://github.com/splunk/TA-osquery) must
  be deployed across your indexers and universal forwarders in order to have the data populate the Endpoint data model.

known_false_positives: At this stage, there are no known false positives. During testing, no process events refering the com.apple.loginwindow.plist files were observed during normal operation of re-opening applications on reboot. Therefore, it can be asumed that any occurences of this in the process events would be worth investigating. In the event that the legitimate modification by the system of these files is in fact logged to the process log, then the process_name of that process can be whitelisted.
